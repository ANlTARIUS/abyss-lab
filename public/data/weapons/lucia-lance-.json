If the thrust hits an enemy who is not in Invincibility or Iron Body state, then unleashes Throw ATK, controlling the target and dealing 90%+1,200.0% ATK of Physical DMG. While an enemy is launching certain moves, the wielder can unleash a counterstrike Throw with no restrictions when the weapon skill button flashes to control the enemy and deal 20%+600.0% ATK of Physical DMG; this attack has no CD.
