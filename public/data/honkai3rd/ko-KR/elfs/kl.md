## A New Request?

ELF has two forms of Basic ATK:
Basic ATK 1: Launch syringes to deal 5 × 120% ATK of Lighting DMG.
Basic ATK 2: Unleash biochemical lightning to deal 3 × 200% ATK of Lighting DMG.
ATK Interval: 3.3s

### Sure, No Problem

Each hit of Basic ATK has a 50.0% chance to inflict one stack of Fatigue on enemies. The chance is doubled on enemies not yet inflicted.

### Just Put It There

ELF restores 2.1 SP per second in battle.

### I'll Finish It on Time

ELF's basic ATKs deal 30.0% bonus Lightning DMG to enemies with Fatigue.

## Quick Sleep Helper

Take out a massive syringe and smash it at enemies to trigger a toxic explosion and deal 1800% ATK of Lighting DMG. The syringe then stays on the field and spread toxin to deal 7 × 300% ATK of Lightning DMG. Casting Ultimate reduces character switch CD by 8s. The 1st hit makes enemies take 10.0% bonus Lighting DMG for 15s. Ultimate inflicts Fatigue on enemies hit for 8s and each stack deals 20% ATK of Lightning DMG per second. Triggering it again resets the duration. 5 stacks max.
CD: 45s
SP: 75

### Puts You to Sleep Instantly

The 1st hit paralyzes enemies for 2.0s.

### Never Gonna Wake Up Again

ELF Ultimate makes enemies take 15.0% bonus Lightning DMG instead.

### Hmm, Very Helpful

ELF Ultimate deals 40.0% bonus Total DMG. Casting Ultimate triggers the QTE of all Lightning DMG dealers on the team.

## Still Got Work to Do

## Did I Fall Asleep?

Valkyries dealing Combo ATK DMG adds 1 to the count for up to once per second. When the count reaches 3, ELF performs a Joint ATK, clears the count, and launches multiple syringes at the target, dealing 10 x 80% ATK of Lightning DMG. CD: 20s. The count cannot exceed 2 during CD and starts with 2 when the battle begins.

### What Time Is It Now?

Joint ATKs can inflict Fatigue.
