# Dirac

Quantum Waltz Set

## 2nd Quantization 2 Pieces

If any 2 stigmata effects are active, gain 35.0% Physical DMG. When this effect is triggered, the durations of both stigmata effects are reset and extended to 14s.

## Dirac Equation 3 Pieces

If all 3 stigmata effects are active, Ultimate/Burst mode ATKs also apply Impair to non-impaired enemies on hit, lowering their DEF by 50.0% for 3s. When this effect is triggered, the durations of all 3 stigmata effects are reset and extended to 18s.
