## Lightning Chord 2 세트

Every Basic ATK (including Charged and Combo ATKs) grants 1 Accord Charge stack (CD: 1s). After gaining 4 Accord Charge stacks, reset stacks to zero and unleash Chain Lightning that attacks 4 random targets, paralyzing them for 5 sec and dealing 600% ATK of Lightning DMG to the first target, with each leap dealing 20% less total Lightning DMG to enemies. Chain lightning does not hit the same target twice. CD: 15s.

## Advanced Chord 3 세트

Gain 20% Max HP and 40% Lightning DMG in battle. Lightning DMG dealt by Chain Lightning no longer decays with each leap.
