Vampire Prince Set

## Kindred 2 세트

Upon scoring a crit hit, summon 1 Kindred that lasts 10s, and resets the duration of all existing Kindreds. The Kindred deals 50% ATK of Physical DMG (DMG is directly based on the host and benefit from the host's stat bonuses). Up to 3 Kindreds can exist at the same time, each increasing the host's Crit DMG by 15%.

## Resurrection 3 세트

When HP is below 1%, activate Revival Mode that lasts 5s, during which the host cannot attack nor move but is invincible and heals 20% of HP per second. When Revival Mode ends, knock surrounding enemies airborne and bleed them for 5s, dealing 20% ATK of Physical DMG per second. CD: 300s.
