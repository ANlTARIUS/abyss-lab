# Otto Apocalypse

Schicksal Overseer Set

## Spear of Punishment 2 세트

Every Basic ATK grants 1 Charge stack (CD: 0.8s). After gaining 3 Charge stacks, the next charged attack hitting an enemy generates a Punishment Field with a 3-meter radius that lasts 4.0s. Enemies inside the field become conductive and take 40% more Lightning DMG. This effect cannot stack.

## Spear of Sky 3 세트

Charges once every 5s. The next charged attack adds a Sky Brand to the target. The Sky Brand explodes after a 0.5s delay, dealing 80% ATK of Lightning DMG to nearby enemies.
