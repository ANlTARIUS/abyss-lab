    "description": "Team has 1.00 longer pick-up range (cannot stack). Every second or every successful hit grants 1 charge (independent stacking methods). At 12 charges, the next enemy hit drops a candy (CD: 2s). 12 charges at stage entry. Unpicked candies will disappear in 8s. Picking up a candy induces Gluttony State, where the team deals 16.0% bonus Total DMG for 5s. Picking up another candy in Gluttony State boosts bonus Total DMG to 24.0% and resets the duration."
